### Note that - 
- Don't use microfrontend blindly. 
- `https://rangle.io/blog/five-things-to-consider-before-choosing-micro-frontends/`
- One Quote that makes sense:
```the complexity of the libraries and frameworks you use should not overshadow the complexity of the app```


### Steps to Setup
- `lerna run bootstrap`
- `lerna run build`
- `docker-compose up --build`
- Open in browser `https://localhost:3000`
